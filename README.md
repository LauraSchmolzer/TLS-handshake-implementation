# TLS handshake implementation in Python
This project is meant to simulate a simplified TLS handshake in Python to learn the core cryptographic operations, message flows and security guarantees that are involved in establishing a secure communication channel between Client and Server.

This project will focus on my personal learning objectives on applied cryptography and is not intended to be a production-ready TLS implementation. My project will not include any TLS extensions.

## Objectives:
- Develop a Python-based TLS client and server that communicate over separate terminal.
- Implement a minimal, but cryptographically correct, TLS handshake.
- Provide detailed logging for educational and debugging purposes.
- Enable an interactive terminal that supports secure bidirectional messaging between client and server after the session establishment.
- Shortly emphasise and report the cryptographic inner workings of TLS 1.3.
